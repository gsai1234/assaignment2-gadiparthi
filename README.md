###### GOA
>Goa is a state in **western** India with coastlines stretching along the Arabian Sea. Its long history as a Portuguese colony prior to 1961 is evident in its preserved 17th-century churches and the areaâ€™s tropical spice plantations. **Goa is also known for its beaches, ranging from popular stretches at Baga and Palolem to those in laid-back fishing villages such as Agonda**

If the distance is less than the radius, the line must intersect the circle at two distinct points. if the distance is equal to the radius, then the line will touch the circle. if the distance is greater than the radius, the line will lie completely outside the circle.

```
double r, a, b, c; // given as input
double x0 = -a*c/(a*a+b*b), y0 = -b*c/(a*a+b*b);
if (c*c > r*r*(a*a+b*b)+EPS)
    puts ("no points");
else if (abs (c*c - r*r*(a*a+b*b)) < EPS) {
    puts ("1 point");
    cout << x0 << ' ' << y0 << '\n';
}
else {
    double d = r*r - c*c/(a*a+b*b);
    double mult = sqrt (d / (a*a+b*b));
    double ax, ay, bx, by;
    ax = x0 + b * mult;
    bx = x0 - b * mult;
    ay = y0 - a * mult;
    by = y0 + a * mult;
    puts ("2 points");
    cout << ax << ' ' << ay << '\n' << bx << ' ' << by << '\n';
}
```
